## How to Use

### ⚠️ Prerequisites

**CRITICAL: Local CORS Proxy Must Be Running**

Before using the stock analysis features, you **MUST** start the local CORS proxy server:

```powershell
# Run with Node.js
node js/cors-proxy.js
```

The proxy enables fetching data from Groww and Yahoo Finance. Without it, data fetching will fail.

**Keep the proxy running in the background** while using the application.

### Local Development

1. Clone or download this folder
2. Run a local web server from the project root
   - Example: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Or use a simple Node.js server of your choice
3. Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser

> ⚠️ Opening files directly with `file://` will break Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database access. Use an HTTP origin such as `http://localhost` for login and cloud sync to work.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

1. **Create a GitHub repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "main" branch
   - Select root folder or `/docs` folder (if you moved files there)
   - Click "Save"

3. **Access Your Site**
   - Your site will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/`
   - Wait a few minutes for the initial deployment

### Using the Application

1. **Home Page**: Overview of features and getting started guide
2. **Analysis Page**: 
   - Sign up or login with email/password or Google
   - Add stocks by entering Symbol and Company Name
   - Click "Edit" to enter fundamental metrics
   - Compare multiple stocks in a table view
   - Delete stocks you no longer need
   - Clear all stocks at once
   - Data automatically syncs to cloud
3. **Firebase Setup** (Already Integrated):
   - See [FIREBASE_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md](FIREBASE_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md) for setup details
   - Firebase Authentication enabled (Email/Password + Google)
   - Firebase Realtime Database configured
   - Real-time sync working

## 🔄 Data Fetching

### Dual Source Integration
The app now fetches data from **two sources simultaneously**:

1. **Groww.in**: Fetches fundamental metrics like ROE, P/E, Debt-to-Equity, Promoter Holdings, etc.
2. **Yahoo Finance**: Fetches additional metrics like ROA (%), EBITDA, P/S YoY, and **BETA (5Y Monthly)**

When you click the **Fetch** button:
- Both sources are queried in parallel using `Promise.all()`
- Data is combined automatically
- The UI displays metrics from both sources
- If one source fails, the other continues (non-blocking)

### Beta Value Crawling ⭐ NEW
The **BETA** metric is now automatically fetched from Yahoo Finance:
- **What is Beta?**: Measures stock volatility relative to the market
  - Beta < 1: Less volatile than market
  - Beta = 1: Moves with market
  - Beta > 1: More volatile than market
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance Key Statistics page
- **Location**: Trading Information → Stock Price History → Beta (5Y Monthly)
- **Example**: TCS has Beta ~0.30, meaning it's less volatile than the market

#### CORS Proxy Setup

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: The local CORS proxy MUST be running for data fetching to work!**

**Start CORS Proxy** (required for fetching external data):

```bash
node js/cors-proxy.js
```

The proxy will start on `http://localhost:8080` and must remain running while using the app.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you get "port already in use" error, the proxy may already be running
- Check running process: `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080`
- Stop existing: Find process PID and use `Stop-Process -Id <PID>`

### Yahoo Symbol Mapping
The file `resource/yahoo-symbols.json` maps stock symbols to Yahoo Finance format:
```json
{
  "ITC": "ITC.NS",
  "TCS": "TCS.NS",
  "RELIANCE": "RELIANCE.NS"
}
```

To add new stocks, update this file with the appropriate Yahoo Finance symbol (usually `SYMBOL.NS` for NSE stocks).

- ✅ Real-time sync across all devices
- ✅ User authentication and security
- ✅ Access from anywhere
- ✅ Offline support with automatic sync

                ├── quickRatio: "1.2"
                └── ... (all 13 metrics)
```

## 🚀 Firebase Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Google account for Firebase Console access
2. Firebase project created at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Enable Firebase Services** (in Firebase Console):
   - Authentication → Sign-in method → Enable Email/Password and Google
   - Realtime Database → Create database → Start in test mode
   - Update security rules for production (see FIREBASE_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md)

2. **Configure Application**:
   - Your Firebase config is already integrated in `js/firebase-config.js`
   - Config is gitignored for security
   - Use `firebase-config.example.js` as template for new setups

3. **Deploy**:
   - Follow GitHub Pages deployment steps above
   - Or serve locally: `python3 -m http.server 8000`

### Security Rules (Production)
Update Realtime Database rules:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$userId": {
        ".read": "$userId === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$userId === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
